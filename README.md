# JDLisp

This is my own code from completing [Build your own lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), it contains the implementation of the code from the book as well as a few additions I added when completing the exercises in the book. This involves a more expansive set of builtin functions to the language, a decimal type that supports floating point calculations and a separate boolean type. These types support operations between themselves and the base number type.
